# ðŸ“‹ Business Requirements Document

- This document outlines the business requirements for the DataCo Supply Chain Analysis Project. It serves as a high-level guide for stakeholders, team members, and anyone reviewing our GitHub repository.
- The requirements are derived from real-world supply chain challenges faced by companies like DataCo Global, focusing on optimizing operations, reducing costs, and improving customer satisfaction using the DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset.
- These requirements are tool-agnosticâ€”they emphasize business outcomes and deliverables rather than specific technologies. Our team of four leverages complementary tools (Excel for financial modeling, SQL for data management, Tableau for visualization, and Python for advanced analytics) to deliver integrated solutions.
## Project Context
- DataCo Global is a multinational e-commerce company managing a complex supply chain involving customer orders, product distribution, shipping, and global logistics.
- The dataset provides comprehensive data on 180,000+ orders from 2015â€“2018, including customer profiles, product details, order status, delivery metrics, and financials.
- Key challenges include late deliveries, high shipping costs, inefficient inventory management, and regional performance variations.
## Project Scope: Analyze the dataset to identify bottlenecks, forecast demand, optimize costs, and recommend actionable strategies. Out of scope: Real-time system integration or custom data collection.
## Assumptions:

* Dataset quality is sufficient after basic cleaning (e.g., handling missing values in delivery dates).
* Analysis focuses on historical trends; no external data sources are required.
* Deliverables must be reproducible and documented for stakeholder review.

## Business Goals
The primary goals are to:

1. Improve Delivery Performance: Reduce late delivery rates by 20% through process optimization.
2. Optimize Costs: Identify opportunities to cut shipping and operational costs by 15% without impacting service levels.
3. Enhance Customer Insights: Segment customers and predict behaviors to boost retention and revenue.
4. Support Strategic Decisions: Provide forecasting and risk assessment for inventory and market expansion.
5. Enable Data-Driven Reporting: Create accessible insights for executives and operations teams.

## Key Business Requirements
These requirements are prioritized into Must-Have (M), Should-Have (S), and Could-Have (C) categories. They cover the end-to-end supply chain: Planning, Sourcing, Making, Delivering, and Returning.
1. ### Data Management and Quality Requirements (M)

* Ensure data integrity by validating key fields (e.g., order dates, customer locations, product categories).
* Handle data inconsistencies such as missing values in shipping metrics or duplicate orders.
* Create a centralized data model supporting queries across orders, customers, products, and logistics.
* Document data lineage (source to analysis) for auditability.

2. ### Performance Analysis Requirements (M)

* Measure on-time delivery rates by region, product category, shipping mode, and customer segment.
* Analyze lead times (order to delivery) and identify bottlenecks (e.g., processing delays, transit issues).
* Track key supply chain KPIs: Average days for shipping (real vs. scheduled), late delivery risk, order fulfillment rates.
* Compare performance across geographic areas (e.g., city/state-level delivery success).

3. ### Financial and Cost Optimization Requirements (S)

* Calculate cost-to-serve metrics (shipping costs per order, profit margins by category/region).
* Evaluate the financial impact of delays (e.g., refunds, lost sales) and recommend mitigation strategies.
* Analyze pricing effectiveness and simulate scenarios for cost reduction (e.g., carrier selection, volume discounts).
* Forecast revenue and costs based on historical trends and seasonal patterns.

4. ### Customer and Demand Insights Requirements (S)

* Segment customers by behavior (e.g., RFM: Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) and delivery experience.
* Identify high-risk customers for churn due to poor service and recommend retention tactics.
* Analyze demand patterns by product, region, and time to support inventory planning.
* Assess geographic trends (e.g., high-demand areas for expansion).

5. ### Risk and Forecasting Requirements (C)

* Predict late delivery risks using historical patterns (e.g., by seller, product weight, or route).
* Develop demand forecasts for the next 30â€“90 days to optimize stock levels and avoid overstock/understock.
* Evaluate supply chain risks (e.g., regional disruptions) and propose contingency plans.

6. ### Reporting and Visualization Requirements (M)

* Generate executive summaries with KPIs (e.g., dashboards showing delivery trends, cost breakdowns).
* Create interactive reports for operations teams (e.g., drill-down by order ID or region).
* Ensure visualizations are accessible (e.g., maps for geographic analysis, charts for trends).
* Include recommendations with quantified ROI (e.g., "Switching carriers saves $X annually").

7. ### Integration and Scalability Requirements (C)

* Design outputs compatible for multiple users (e.g., exportable to Excel for finance, views for querying).
* Ensure analysis can scale to larger datasets or future updates.
* Document assumptions and limitations (e.g., data is historical; external factors like weather not included).

## Success Metrics and KPIs

* Delivery: On-time delivery rate (>95% target), average lead time reduction (days saved).
* Financial: Cost per order (<10% reduction), profit margin improvement (5% uplift).
* Customer: Retention rate (>85%), customer satisfaction score (based on delivery feedback proxies).
* Operational: Inventory turnover ratio (optimized), forecast accuracy (>80%).
* Project: All deliverables completed on time; stakeholder approval via demo.

## Risks and Constraints

* Data Risks: Incomplete records may bias analysis (mitigation: sensitivity testing).
* Scope Creep: Stick to dataset features; avoid unrelated ML experiments.
* Timeline: 8-week project; delays in data access could impact deliverables.
* Resources: Limited to free tools; no cloud computing budget.

## Stakeholder Expectations

* Executives: High-level insights and ROI recommendations.
* Operations: Actionable process improvements.
* Finance: Cost models and forecasts.
* Customers/IT: No direct interaction; focus on internal tools.

## Project Deliverables
The project will produce the following integrated outputs, ensuring collaboration across the team:

1. Data Infrastructure: Cleaned dataset, database schema, and preprocessing scripts (reusable for future analysis).
2. Analysis Reports: Detailed insights on performance, costs, and risks (PDF/Word format with charts).
3. Financial Models: Scenario planning tools for cost optimization (e.g., Excel-based simulators).
4. Visual Dashboards: Interactive visualizations of KPIs and trends (e.g., Tableau workbooks).
5. Predictive Insights: Forecasts and risk assessments (e.g., Python notebooks with outputs).
6. Recommendations Deck: Executive presentation summarizing findings and action items (PowerPoint/Google Slides).
7. Documentation: Full project report, code comments, and README updates for reproducibility.
8. Demo Session: Live walkthrough of all deliverables for validation.

All deliverables will be version-controlled in this GitHub repo and include setup instructions (see Dataset Setup below).
