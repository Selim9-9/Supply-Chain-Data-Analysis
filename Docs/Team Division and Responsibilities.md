# Team Division and Responsibilities
- Based on the business requirements above, our four-person team is divided by expertise and tools to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- Each member owns specific areas but collaborates on integration (e.g., shared data exports). Assignments align with the requirements for balanced workload:
### Team Member 1: Data Management & Performance Specialist

* Primary Tool: SQL (for structuring data and querying KPIs).
* Responsibilities (Tied to Requirements 1 & 2):

Lead data import, cleaning, and quality assurance.
Build queries for performance metrics (e.g., lead times, delivery rates by region).
Create views/tables for team-wide use.
Contribute to risk analysis by extracting logistics data.


* **Key Deliverables**: Database schema, KPI views, performance report sections.
* Focus: Ensures reliable data foundation for all analyses.

### Team Member 2: Financial & Cost Analyst

* Primary Tool: Excel (for modeling and scenario analysis).
* Responsibilities (Tied to Requirements 3 & 6):

Develop cost models and financial simulations (e.g., shipping cost breakdowns).
Analyze profitability by segment and recommend optimizations.
Create budget forecasts and ROI calculations.
Support reporting with financial summaries.


* **Key Deliverables**: Excel workbooks with dashboards, cost-benefit analyses, pricing scenarios.
* Focus: Translates data into financial insights for decision-making.

### Team Member 3: Visualization & Reporting Expert

* Primary Tool: Tableau (for dashboards and geographic visuals).
* Responsibilities (Tied to Requirements 4 & 6):

Design interactive dashboards for KPIs (e.g., delivery heat maps, customer trends).
Visualize geographic and customer insights (e.g., regional performance).
Integrate outputs from other team members for unified reporting.
Prepare executive summaries and demo materials.


* **Key Deliverables**: Tableau dashboards, interactive maps, final presentation deck.
* Focus: Makes complex insights accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

### Team Member 4: Analytics & Forecasting Lead

* Primary Tool: Python (for advanced modeling and predictions).
* Responsibilities (Tied to Requirements 5 & 7):

Build demand forecasts and risk models (e.g., late delivery predictions).
Perform customer segmentation and trend analysis.
Automate preprocessing and integrate with other tools (e.g., export to SQL/Excel).
Validate scalability and document advanced techniques.


* **Key Deliverables**: Python scripts/notebooks, forecast reports, risk assessments.
* Focus: Provides forward-looking insights for strategic planning.

### Cross-Team Collaboration

* Weekly Syncs: Review progress against requirements; share data exports.
* Integration Points: SQL outputs feed Excel/Tableau; Python models enhance forecasts in reports.
* Quality Gates: Peer reviews for accuracy; final validation against KPIs.

### Dataset Setup
(Due to file size limits, the dataset is not in this repo. See the main README.md for download instructions from Kaggle. Place files in /data/raw/ after extraction.)
